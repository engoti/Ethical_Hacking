WiFi Scanner and Password Cracker
This Python project scans available WiFi networks and attempts to crack a selected WiFi networkâ€™s password using a brute-force approach with a password dictionary.

Warning: This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal and unethical. Only use this tool on networks you have permission to test.

Features
WiFi Scanner: Lists available WiFi networks and displays their signal strength.
Password Cracker: Attempts to brute-force a WiFi network's password using a dictionary file.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pywifi library for managing WiFi connections in Python. Install it using:
bash
Copy code
pip install pywifi
How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WiFiScannerPasswordCracker.git
cd WiFiScannerPasswordCracker
Run the Program:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
WiFi Scan:

The program first scans for available WiFi networks and displays a list sorted by signal strength.
Each WiFi network is shown with a number, strength, and name.
Select Target WiFi:

Input the number corresponding to the WiFi network you want to target.
Confirm your selection.
Password Cracking:

The program will prompt you to provide the file path of a password dictionary.
It will then attempt to connect to the target WiFi network by trying each password in the file until successful or until it exhausts the list.
If a password is found, it will display the password.
Code Overview
The program consists of three main functions:

wifi_scan(): Scans for available WiFi networks and lists them by signal strength.
wifi_password_crack(wifi_name): Attempts to crack the WiFi password of a given network using a password dictionary.
main(): Manages the program flow, prompting the user for input and handling exceptions.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
# To run the program
python main.py
Sample Output
Program scans available WiFi networks:

scss

Scan Completed!
--------------------------------------
No.  Strength  WiFi Name
0    90        MyHomeNetwork
1    75        CafeFreeWiFi
Select a WiFi network and provide a password dictionary file:

yaml
Copy code
Please choose a target wifi: 0
The chosen target wifi is: MyHomeNetwork. Sure? (Y/N): Y
Please use filename of password dictionary used for the brute force attack: passwords.txt
If a password is found, the program outputs:

yaml
Copy code
Connection Succeeded! Password: mypassword123
